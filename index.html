        <p>In the lockdown, we were forced to stay at home â€” with or without families. It was also a time when we
            stepped into the kitchen to cook and look after ourselves. Multiple food trends came to the fore: from
            Dalgona coffee to banana bread, and more. And before we realised, social media became a platform for budding
            home-bakers, one-minute recipes and many new food bloggers.</p>
